## A rust minecraft launcher

## Features

- [x] can actually download minecraft
- [x] (secure!) authentication builtin via oauth2
- [x] quickplay support

**MICROSOFT ONLY** because Mojang is being removed in the future. Migrate now _or else_

Currently, this is being used as the launcher backend for the Glowsquid launcher.


## TODO
- Full tauri bindings
