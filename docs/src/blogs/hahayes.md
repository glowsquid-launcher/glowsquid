# This is yes

pretty pog ngl. 

<br>

Astro is pog as it automatically converts this to html for me and I can just use the object

The object looks something like this:

<br>

```json
{
   "title": "haha yes",
   "description": "haha y e s blogs now work",
   "author": "A badly drawn TABS person", 
   "slug": "haha yes",
   "astro": {
       "source": {
           "markdown": "markdown here",
           "html": "html here"
       }
   }
}
```
